Job Lens AI is an end-to-end, AI-driven web application designed to help users analyze their job market fit and automate interview preparation. The tool scrapes real-time job postings, performs a deep resume-to-job-description comparison using large language models, and provides users with a comprehensive analysis package including a match score, tailored resume content, and a custom-generated cover letter.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **üåê Real-Time Job Scraping**: Fetches live job postings directly from LinkedIn using a keyword and location search.
*   **üß† Intelligent Resume Analysis**: Leverages the Groq API (running Llama 3.1) to perform a deep semantic comparison between a user's resume and a job description.
*   **üìä Comprehensive Feedback**: Delivers a detailed analysis including:
    *   A **resume match percentage** and ATS score.
    *   A rewritten, **tailored resume** with bullet points optimized for the target job.
    *   A professionally crafted **cover letter**.
*   **‚ö° Scalable & Performant Backend**: Implements multithreading for parallel API requests to both LinkedIn and the Groq API, minimizing user latency during scraping and analysis.
*   **‚òÅÔ∏è Secure Cloud Integration**: Utilizes Google Firebase (Firestore) to manage a user credit system and persist user data in a secure, scalable cloud environment.
*   **üë§ Frictionless User Onboarding**: Employs IP-based authentication to manage user sessions and credits without requiring a traditional login, reducing user friction.
*   **üëë Admin Dashboard**: A protected admin panel allows for monitoring user activity and managing credit allocations directly from the UI.

## üöÄ How It Works

The application operates in a simple, multi-step flow designed for an intuitive user experience.

1.  **Find Jobs**: The user enters a job title and location. The application scrapes LinkedIn for relevant job postings and displays them in a clean, interactive table.
2.  **Upload Resume & Select**: The user uploads their resume (PDF or TXT) or pastes the content directly. They then select up to 3 jobs from the scraped list for analysis.
3.  **Run AI Analysis**: The app sends the resume and each selected job description to the Groq API. The backend processes these requests in parallel. The UI updates in real-time, showing the status of each job analysis as it completes.
4.  **Review & Download**: Completed analyses are displayed with the match score, tailored advice, and the generated LaTeX code for the updated resume and cover letter.
